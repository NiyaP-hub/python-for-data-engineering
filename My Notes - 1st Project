==========Code============
import pandas as pd                //import/load the pandas library (a tool for working with tables). pd is the alias
df = pd.read_csv("sales.csv")      //Use pandas (alias pd) to read the file named sales.csv, and store it in a variable called df.
print(df.head())                   //shows just the top of the table (5 rows). 
                                   // df = short for DataFrame — a table of data (like a mini Excel sheet)

==========================
*PANDAS library is used to work with structured data — like tables in Excel, CSV, SQL, APIs that return structured data

USE CASE : Read, clean, transform, join, summarize, or analyze structured data.
    
       - You have CSV/Excel/SQL data	Read and load the data
       - Data has missing values	Fill or remove them
       - You need to filter rows/columns	Use slicing or conditions
       - You want to summarize	Use groupby, mean, sum, etc.
       - You want to join tables	Use merge() like SQL JOIN
       - You’re automating reports	Script it once, re-run anytime
       - Excel is slow with big data	pandas handles large datasets faster


=========================


NOTE: Pandas must be installed in your machine through command prompt :

    pip install pandas  //pip is Python’s package installer.This command uses pip to install the pandas library.


IF you get a message saying could not found pip, it means your Python installation is missing the pip tool, 
which is used to install packages like pandas

To install Pandas:

    which python3   //Check Which Python You’re Using

    Output might be: 

    /usr/bin/python3           //The macOS system Python.Not recommended (restricted, outdated)
    or
    /opt/homebrew/bin/python3  //Python installed via Homebrew.
    or
    /usr/local/bin/python3     //Python installed via python.org installer

python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade   // This asks Python to install pip if it’s missing.

python3 -m pip install pandas  //next , install pandas

===============================EXECUTING PYTHON CODE=====================

OPTION 1: TO EXECUTE CODE IN Visual Studio Code :

Open new editor and save as .py 
Type the code in this editor
By default , VSCode will look for the file in the current folder (i.e. where your python code (.py) file is saved)
In order to find your current folder - > In VS Code Editor , go to Terminal (top ribbon) ->New Terminal -> pwd (gives your current directory)
      e.g. /Users/niya/Documents/python-learning
If the csv file is not in the current folder, you need to give full path in your command:
      df = pd.read_csv("/Users/niya/Desktop/data/sales.csv")


OPTION 2: TO EXECUTE CODE IN TERMINAL :

python3  //Tells Terminl I want to use Python 3 interpreter to run a Python command or script.

e.g.1: python3 
       my_script.py

e.g.2:  python3 ///Tells Terminl I want to use Python 3 interpreter to run a Python command or script. Next, type your code

        import pandas as pd  //
        df = pd.read_csv("sales.csv")
        print(df.head())
