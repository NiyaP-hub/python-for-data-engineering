import pandas as pd                //import/load the pandas library (a tool for working with tables). pd is the alias
df = pd.read_csv("sales.csv")      //Use pandas (alias pd) to read the file named sales.csv, and store it in a variable called df.
print(df.head())                   //shows just the top of the table (5 rows). 
                                   // df = short for DataFrame — a table of data (like a mini Excel sheet)

==========================
*PANDAS library is used to work with structured data — like tables in Excel, CSV, SQL, APIs that return structured data

USE CASE : Read, clean, transform, join, summarize, or analyze structured data.
    
       - You have CSV/Excel/SQL data	Read and load the data
       - Data has missing values	Fill or remove them
       - You need to filter rows/columns	Use slicing or conditions
       - You want to summarize	Use groupby, mean, sum, etc.
       - You want to join tables	Use merge() like SQL JOIN
       - You’re automating reports	Script it once, re-run anytime
       - Excel is slow with big data	pandas handles large datasets faster


=========================


NOTE: Pandas must be installed in your machine through command prompt :

pip install pandas

IF you get a message saying could not found pip, it means your Python installation is missing the pip tool, 
which is used to install packages like pandas

To install Pandas:

    which python3   //Check Which Python You’re Using

    Output might be: 

    /usr/bin/python3
    or
    /opt/homebrew/bin/python3
    or
    /usr/local/bin/python3




=========================
To execute the above code in Visual Studio Code 

Open new editor and save as .py 
Type the code in this editor
By default , VSCode will look for the cs file in the current folder (i.e. where your python code (.py) file is saved
In order to find your current folder - > VS Code Editor -> Terminal (top ribbon) ->New Terminal -> pwd (gives your current directory)
      e.g. /Users/niya/Documents/python-learning
If the csv file is not in the current folder, you need to give full path in your command:
      df = pd.read_csv("/Users/niya/Desktop/data/sales.csv")
