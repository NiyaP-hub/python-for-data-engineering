Step 1: Intsall Python
(already installed in Mac)
 Check version : python --version

Step 2: Install jupyter notebook
*A notebook is a rich, interactive way to write code, explain it, and see results — all in one place.

      Option 1 : Through Terminal
                 pip install jupyter notebook //  install through command prompt
                 jupyter notebook      //  once installed, use this command in the command prompt to lauch the notebook in the browser

      Option 2 : Instead of installing jupyter notebook, use Google Colab and use notebook from the there

      Note: you can also run the code in the command prompt i.e. terminal itself as well instead of notebook but notebook is a rich UI

      Option 3 : You can do everything in one place using Visual Studio Code instead

              You need below to run Python in VS Code:
              
              1. Python Extension (By Microsoft ) = Helper in the editor
              2. Interpreter = Engine that runs your code
              3. Jupyter Extension (By Microsoft) = The VS Code plugin that lets you work with .ipynb notebooks inside VS Code
              
              Python Extension (VS Code) : Adds Python support to VS Code. Installed via Extensions tab in VS Code
              Python Interpreter (System): Actually runs Python code.  Installed via Terminal or python.org
              
              *VS Code Python extension like a translator — it helps VS Code understand.
              The Python Extension in VS Code: adds features to VS Code, like:
              
                  Syntax highlighting
                  Code suggestions
                  Debugging tools
                  Jupyter notebook support
              
              * Interpreter is the real Python engine that runs your .py files
              
              Interpreter = The car engine
              Jupyter Extension = The dashboard that lets you drive and see what’s happening.
              Without the Jupyter extension, you won’t get the notebook UI (cells, run buttons, output areas, markdown formatting, etc.) in VS Code.
